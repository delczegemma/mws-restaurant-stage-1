## Description

The Restaurant Review app is a project provided for Udacity-students. In the FEND path, there is the 6 project out of 8. From a given sample (which you can find at the [Udacity repository] (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) the students must build a responsive, highly accesible page with offline availbe content through a service worker.

## Project Instructions

In this project I developed the given sample to have a mobile first, responsive experience. The content loads through a service worker, which saves every seen element in a local cache, so in offline mode or with low internet connection there are avaible contents. 
To see this project from your device, you need to run a local server. Here I describe below every steps for to run it.

## Installation

1.You can download the Zip file from here or Clone this github page
2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and there you can see the application.
